# portfolio_website
## Introduction
This is my first project that I will be publishing on my Github page. I want to create and run a website using AWS and use it as my portfolio. With this project I want to display basic cloud hosting skills like: Content Delivery Network Integration using AWS Cloudfront, DNS configuration, VPN configuration and IAM. I will also only use the AWS commandline for this project.

## 1. Setting up IAM User
The first step of the project is creating a IAM User with only the necessary privileges. This is best practice and will improve security. I configured an user on the AWS management console and gave it AdministratorAccess. 

Next I configured my AWS CLI to use the new account.
```
aws configure
```
